      <h2>Who am I?</h2>
      <p>My name is Jesse Cook. I'm 17 years old and I am excited to be a part
        this Google CSSI program.</p>
      <h2>Background</h2>
    <!-- Add more content -->
      <p>I was born near Stone Mountain and lived there for the first year of
        my life. After that one year, however, the house felt a bit too small,
        so my family moved into the house that we're in today. We will, after
        16 years, be moving very, very soon.
      <h2>Interests</h2>
    <!-- Add in the descriptors later and animate them in JS -->
      <dl id="about-me-interest-list">
        <dt>Classical Music</dt>
        <dt>Computer Engineering</dt>
        <dt>Network Security</dt>
      </dl>
      <h2>Future Aspirations</h2>
      <p>I will be attending Kennesaw State University, starting Fall 2017. Whilst
        I'm there, I intend to pursue a Bachelor's in Computer Engineering and complete
        it in 4 years, while also obtaining a minor in music, with piano concentration.
        I'm not sure what to expect from this. I still have a lot of uncertainty in regards
        to the future, but I am thrilled to know that these opportunties are available
        to me. With that said, I don't know what the future holds and I don't have
        any solid plans for my future yet (aside from college). However, I gladly await the future and look forward
        to seeing what doors open up next.
      </p>
      <h2>Anything Else?</h2>
      <p>Nah, I'm too lazy for that.</p>
